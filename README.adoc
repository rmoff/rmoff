I'm a Principal Developer Advocate at Confluent, the company founded by the original creators of Apache Kafka, as well as an Oracle ACE Director (Alumnus). 

I love working with data and helping Developers get the best out of it and the surrounding ecosystem of tools. 

As an experienced Developer Advocate I like to create content in various forms. Here are some examples:
